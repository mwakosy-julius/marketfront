# Bioinformatics Tools Marketplace

Welcome to the **Bioinformatics Tools & Pipelines Marketplace** 🎉
This platform allows researchers, developers, and creators to **publish, share, and integrate bioinformatics tools** directly into our main analysis platform.

All submitted tools are packaged as **Docker containers**, ensuring reproducibility, portability, and seamless integration.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Create** your tool or pipeline and package it in a Docker container.
2. **Submit** your Dockerfile and metadata following the guidelines below.
3. **Review & Integration**: Our team tests your tool for compatibility and performance.
4. **Publish**: Once approved, your tool will appear in the marketplace and can be used by the community.

---

## 📦 Requirements for Tools
- Must include a valid `Dockerfile`.
- Must contain clear **entrypoints** (e.g., `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` in Docker).
- Should accept **standard input/output formats** (e.g., FASTA, FASTQ, BAM, VCF).
- Must include proper **documentation** (usage, parameters, expected input/output).
- Recommended: Lightweight base images (e.g., `python:3.9-slim`, `alpine`, or `ubuntu`).

---

## 🛠️ Submission Guidelines
1. Create a folder under `/tools/your-tool-name/`.
2. Add the following files:
   - `Dockerfile` (required)
   - `tool.yaml` (metadata about your tool, see template below)
   - `README.md` (tool-specific documentation, usage examples)
